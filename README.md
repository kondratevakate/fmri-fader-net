#### Fader Networks for domain adaptation on fMRI: ABIDE-II study 

ABIDE is the largest open-source autism spectrum disorder database with both fMRI data and full phenotype
description. These data were extensively studied based on functional connectivity analysis as well as with deep
learning on raw data, with top models accuracy close to 75% for separate scanning sites. Yet there is still a
problem of models transferability between different scanning sites within ABIDE. In the current paper, we for
the first time perform domain adaptation for brain pathology classification problem on raw neuroimaging data.
We use 3D convolutional autoencoders to build the domain irrelevant latent space image representation and
demonstrate this method to outperform existing approaches on ABIDE data.
